## Plug for R4DS

Although reading a book three times in three years may seem excessive, R4DS is excellent on repeat engagements. After the first read, I felt comfortable doing most common types of data manipulation. On the second, functional programming methods and elegant iteration methods like those demonstrated in [Chapter 25: many models](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) felt easy and intuitive. 

See a lightning talk I gave on "managing many models" ___

On the third R4DS reading, various functions or options I'd forgotten, or not inuited the utility of suddenly popped-out to me as useful things I needed to add to my tool belt to replace less effective methods I'd been using (e.g. `tidyr::enframe()`, `cache.extra` chunk option, ...).

My Master's program had provided me with a broad overview and strong foundation of knowledge on a wide range of analytic methods. However, having bounced between python, R, SQL, and SAS on different projects, the nuts and bolts of my coding skills had yet to mature. 

Job interviews were coming-up and I was nervous my lack of fluency in coding would come through either in code submissions or reviews.
