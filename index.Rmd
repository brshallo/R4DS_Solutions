# Purpose of this book

This book contains my solutions and notes to Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham's book, *R for Data Science* (R4DS). First and foremost my book is set-up as a resource and refresher for myself. 

If you are looking for a place to check your solutions for R4DS I would recommend using Jrnold's solutions ___ as a source. Jrnold has done a great job of getting community feedback and well vetted solutions. Though feel free to use this book as another point of reference.

## Features of this book

Most chapters contain the following:
* list of functions and notes from the chapter^[When functions show up in multiple locations I typically only note them the first time they appear.]. 
* Solutions to exercises^[Chapters without exercises are generally not included.]
* "Appendices" contaiing alternative solutions to problems, or random notes/thoughts related to specific problems or the chapter more generally
* I use the numbering scheme {chapter}.{section}.{subsection}.{problem number}

## Origin of this book

*R for Data Science* (R4DS) is my go-to recommendation for getting started in "data science", R programming, or the "tidyverse". 

I first read and completed the exercises to R4DS in early 2017 on the tail-end of completing a Master's in Analytics program. My second time going through R4DS came in early 2018 when myself and a colleague (_Stephen Kimel_) organized an internal study group in our company at NetApp^[You can see my part of an internal talk I gave plugging "tidy" data science workflows (and implicitly the R4DS study group) here: __.].

The study group provided me a chance to clean-up my solutions, organize my notes, and pursue a vague ambition to publish my solutions and notes online into a book. After stumbling into Jrnold's online R4DS solutions this ambition no longer felt useful... but, roughly a year later, I got around to publishing it.

## Acknowledgements

Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund for their amazing book as well as the entire team at RStudio for producing outstanding packages, products, and learning materials. Stephen Kimel and my colleagues at NetApp for going through our study group together. The (R4DS community)[] and rstats communities for creating such welcoming and inspiring environments for learning.
