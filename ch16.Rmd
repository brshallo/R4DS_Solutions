# ch. 16: Dates and times

* `today` get current date
* `now` get current date-time
* `ymd_hms` one example of straight-forward set-of of functions that take either strings or unquoted numbers and output dates or date-times
* `make_datetime` create date-time from individual components, e.g. make_datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute)
* `as_datetime` and `as_date` let you switch between date-time and dates, e.g. `as_datetime(today())` or `as_date(now())`
* Accessor functions let you pull out components from an existing date-time:
    + `year`, `month`, `mday`, `yday`, `wday`, `hour`, `minute`, `second`
        + `month` and `wday` have `label = TRUE` to pull the abbreviated name rather than the number, and pull full name with `abbr = FALSE`
    + You can also use these to set particular components `year(datetime) <- 2020`
* `update` allows you to specify multiple values at one time, e.g. `update(datetime, year = 2020, month = 2, mday = 2, hour = 2)`
    + When values are too big they roll-over e.g. `update(ymd("2015-02-01"), mday = 30)` will become '2015-03-02'
* Rounding functions to nearest unit of time
    + `floor_date`, `round_date`, `ceiling_date`
* `as.duration` convert diff-time to a duration
* Durations (can add and multiply):
    + `dseconds`, `dhours`, `ddays`, `dweeks`, `dyears`
* Periods (can add and multiply), more likely to do what you expect than duration:
    + `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months`
* Interval is a duration with a starting point, making it precise and possible to determine EXACT length
    + e.g. `(today() %--% next_year) / ddays(1)` to find exact duration
* `Sys.timezone` to see what R thinks your current time zone is
* `tz = ` arg in `ymd_hms` let's you change printing behavior (not underlying value, as assumes UTC unless changed)
* `with_tz` allows you to print an existing date-time object to a specific other timezone
* `force_tz` when have an object that's been labeled with wrong time-zone and need to fix it

## 16.2: Creating date/times

Note that 1 in date-times is treated as 1 - second in numeric contexts, so example below sets `binwidth = 86400` to specify 1 day

```{r}
make_datetime_100 <- function(year, month, day, time) {
  make_datetime(year, month, day, time %/% 100, time %% 100)
}

flights_dt <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("dep_time", "arr_time", "sched_dep_time", "sched_arr_time"), funs(make_datetime_100(year, month, day, .))) %>% 
  select(origin, dest, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time"))

flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 86400)
```

### 16.2.4

1.  What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?

    ```{r}
    ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
    ```

    * Outputs an NA and sends warning of number that failed to parse

1.  What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?

    * Let's you specify timezones, may be different days depending on location
    
    ```{r}
    today(tzone = "MST")
    now(tzone = "MST")
    ```
    

1.  Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates:

    ```{r}
    d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
    d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
    d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
    d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
    d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
    ```

    ```{r}
    mdy(d1)
    ymd(d2)
    dmy(d3)
    mdy(d4)
    mdy(d5)
    ```

	
## 16.3: Date-time components

This allows you to plot the number of flights per week

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  count(week = floor_date(dep_time, "week")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, n)) +
    geom_line()
```

Accessor functions can also 


### 16.3.4

1.  How does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the 
    course of the year?
    
    *Median flight time by day*
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>%
      transmute(quarter_dep = quarter(dep_time) %>% factor(),
                day_dep = as_date(dep_time),
                dep_time = as.hms(dep_time)) %>% 
      group_by(quarter_dep, day_dep) %>% 
      summarise(day_median = median(dep_time)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = day_dep, y = day_median)) +
      geom_line(aes(colour = quarter_dep, group = 1)) +
      labs(title = "Median flight times by day, coloured by quarter", subtitle = "Q1 and Q4 have several months with typical flight times being slightly earlier")
    
    ```
    
    * First couple and last couple months tend to have slightly earlier start times
    
    *Quantiles of flight times by month*
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>%
      transmute(month_dep = month(dep_time, label = TRUE),
                quarter_dep = quarter(dep_time) %>% factor(),
                wk_dep = week(dep_time),
                dep_time = as.hms(dep_time)) %>% 
      group_by(month_dep, wk_dep) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = month_dep, y = dep_time, group = month_dep)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ```
    
    * Reinforces prior plot, shows that first couple and last couple months of year tend to have slightly higher proportion of flights earlier in day
    
    *Weekly flight proportions by 4 hour blocks*
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>%
      transmute(month_dep = month(dep_time, label = TRUE),
                wk_dep = week(dep_time),
                dep_time_4hrs = floor_date(dep_time, "4 hours"),
                hour_dep_4hrs = hour(dep_time_4hrs) %>% factor) %>% 
      count(wk_dep, hour_dep_4hrs) %>%
      group_by(wk_dep) %>% 
      mutate(wk_tot = sum(n), 
             wk_prop = round(n / wk_tot, 3)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = wk_dep, y = wk_prop)) +
      geom_col(aes(fill = hour_dep_4hrs))
    
    ```
    
    * Last week of the year have a lower proportion of late flights, and a higher proportion of morning flights

    See [16.3.4.1] for a few other plots I looked at.
    
1.  Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time` and `dep_delay`. Are they consistent?
    Explain your findings.

    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>%
      mutate(dep_delay_check = (dep_time - sched_dep_time) / dminutes(1),
             same = dep_delay == dep_delay_check,
             difference = dep_delay_check - dep_delay) %>%
      filter(abs(difference) > 0)
    ```
    
    * They are except in the case when it goes over a day, the day is not pushed forward so it counts it as being 24 hours off

1.  Compare `air_time` with the duration between the departure and arrival.
    Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(air_time_check = (arr_time - dep_time) / dminutes(1)) %>%
      select(air_time_check, air_time, dep_time, arr_time, everything())
    
    ```
    
    * Initial check is off, so need to take into account the time-zone and difference from NYC, so join timezone document
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      left_join(select(nycflights13::airports, dest = faa, tz), by = "dest") %>% 
      mutate(arr_time_new = arr_time - dhours(tz + 5)) %>% 
      mutate(air_time_tz = (arr_time_new - dep_time) / dminutes(1),
             diff_Airtime = air_time_tz - air_time) %>% 
      select( origin, dest, tz, contains("time"), -(contains("sched")))
    
    ```
    
    * Is closer but still off. In chapter 5, problem 5.5.2.1 I go further into this
    * In [Appendix] section [16.3.4.3] filter to NAs
    
1.  How does the average delay time change over the course of a day?
    Should you use `dep_time` or `sched_dep_time`? Why?
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(sched_dep_time = as.hms(floor_date(sched_dep_time, "30 mins"))) %>%
      group_by(sched_dep_time) %>%
      summarise(delay_mean = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE), 
                n = n(),
                n_na = sum(is.na(arr_delay)) / n,
                delay_median = median(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = delay_mean, size = n)) +
      geom_point()
    
    ```
      
    * It goes-up throughout the day
    * Use `sched_dep_time` because it has the correct day

1.  On what day of the week should you leave if you want to minimise the
    chance of a delay?

    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>%
      mutate(weekday = wday(sched_dep_time, label = TRUE)) %>%
      group_by(weekday) %>%
      summarise(prop_delay = sum(dep_delay > 0) / n())
    ```
    
    * wknd has a slightly lower proportion of flights delayed (Thursday has the worst)

1.  What makes the distribution of `diamonds$carat` and 
    `flights$sched_dep_time` similar?
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat)) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 500)+
      labs(title = "Distribution of carat in diamonds dataset")
      
    ggplot(flights, aes(x = as.hms(sched_dep_time))) +
      geom_histogram(bins = 24*6)+
      labs(title = "Distribution of scheduled departure times in flights dataset")
    
    ```
    
    * Both have gaps and peaks at 'attractive' values

1.  Confirm my hypothesis that the early departures of flights in minutes
    20-30 and 50-60 are caused by scheduled flights that leave early. 
    Hint: create a binary variable that tells you whether or not a flight 
    was delayed.
    
    ```{r}
    mutate(flights_dt,
           mins_dep = minute(dep_time),
           mins_sched = minute(sched_dep_time),
           delayed = dep_delay > 0) %>%
      group_by(mins_dep) %>%
      summarise(prop_delayed = sum(delayed) / n()) %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = mins_dep, y = prop_delayed)) +
      geom_line()
    ```
    
    * Consistent with above hypothesis
    
    
	
## 16.4: Time spans

* **durations**, which represent an exact number of seconds.
* **periods**, which represent human units like weeks and months.
* **intervals**, which represent a starting and ending point.

![Permitted arithmetic operations between different data types](datetimes-arithmetic.png)

Periods example, using durations to fix oddity of problem when flight arrives overnight
```{r}
flights_dt <- flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(
    overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
    arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight * 1),
    sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight * 1)
  )
```

Intervals example to get precise number of days dependent on specific time
```{r}
next_year <- today() + years(1)
(today() %--% next_year) / ddays(1)
```

To find out how many periods fall in an interval, need to use integer division
```{r}
(today() %--% next_year) %/% days(1)
```


### 16.4.5

1.  Why is there `months()` but no `dmonths()`?

    * the duration varies from month to month

1.  Explain `days(overnight * 1)` to someone who has just started 
    learning R. How does it work?
    
    * this used in the example above makes it such that if `overnight` is TRUE, it will return the same time period but one day ahead, if false, does not change (as is adding 0 days)

1.  a. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015.

    ```{r}
    x <- ymd("2015-01-01")
    mons <- c(0:11)
    (x + months(mons)) %>% wday(label = TRUE)
    ```

    b. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month
    in the _current_ year.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- today() %>% update(month = 1, mday = 1)
    mons <- c(0:11)
    (x + months(mons)) %>% wday(label=TRUE)
    
    ```
    

1.  Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns 
    how old you are in years.

    ```{r}
    birthday_age <- function(birthday) {
      (ymd(birthday) %--% today()) %/% years(1)
    }
    birthday_age("1989-09-07")
    ```


1.  Why can't `(today() %--% (today() + years(1)) / months(1)` work?
    * Can't add and subtract intervals

# Appendix

## 16.3.4.1

*Weekly median fight time*
```{r}
  
flights_dt %>%
  transmute(quarter_dep = quarter(dep_time) %>% factor(),
            day_dep = as_date(dep_time),
            wk_dep = floor_date(dep_time, "1 week") %>% as_date,
            dep_time = as.hms(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(quarter_dep, wk_dep) %>% 
  summarise(wk_median = median(dep_time)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(wk_median = as.hms(wk_median)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wk_dep, y = wk_median)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = quarter_dep, group = 1)) 
```

*Proportion of flights in each hour, by quarter* 
```{r}
flights_dt %>%
  transmute(quarter_dep = quarter(dep_time) %>% factor(),
            hour_dep = hour(dep_time)) %>% 
  count(quarter_dep, hour_dep) %>%
  group_by(quarter_dep) %>% 
  mutate(quarter_tot = sum(n), 
         quarter_prop = round(n / quarter_tot, 3)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = hour_dep, y = quarter_prop)) +
    geom_line(aes(colour = quarter_dep))
    
```

* Q1 seems to be a little more extreme at the local maximas

*Look at proportion of flights by hour faceted by each month*
```{r}
flights_dt %>%
  transmute(month_dep = month(dep_time, label = TRUE),
            hour_dep = hour(dep_time)) %>% 
  count(month_dep, hour_dep) %>%
  group_by(month_dep) %>% 
  mutate(month_tot = sum(n), 
         month_prop = round(n / month_tot, 3)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour_dep, y = month_prop)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap( ~ month_dep)

```


## 16.3.4.3

* Perhaps these are flights where landed in different location...
```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(arr_delay_test = (arr_time - sched_arr_time) / dminutes(1)) %>% 
  select( origin, dest, dep_delay, arr_delay, arr_delay_test, contains("time")) %>% 
  filter(is.na(arr_delay))
```

## 16.3.4.4

*Below started looking at proportions...
```{r}
mutate(flights_dt,
       dep_old = dep_time,
       sched_old = sched_dep_time,
       dep_time = floor_date(dep_time, "5 minutes"),

  mutate(num_tot = sum(num),
         prop_sched = num / num_tot,
         sched_dep_diff = mins_dep - mins_sched) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mins_dep, y = prop_sched, fill = factor(mins_sched))) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "Proportion of early flights by minute scheduled v. minute departed")

  
  mutate(flights_dt,
       dep_old = dep_time,
       sched_old = sched_dep_time,
       # dep_time = floor_date(dep_time, "5 minutes"),
       # sched_dep_time = floor_date(sched_dep_time, "5 minutes"),
       mins_dep = minute(dep_time),
       mins_sched = minute(sched_dep_time),
       early_less10 = dep_delay >= -10) %>%
  filter(dep_delay < 0) %>% 
  group_by(mins_dep) %>%
  summarise(num = n(),
            sum_recent10 = sum(early_less10),
            prop_recent10 = sum_recent10 / num) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = mins_dep, y = prop_recent10)) +
  geom_line()+
  labs(title = "proportion of early flights that were scheduled to leave within 10 mins of when they did")


```
